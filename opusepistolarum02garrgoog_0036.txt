shortly alter Erasmus moved to Freiburg (Ep. 2226; 01. Ep. 1157), the pro·
jeot, which originated, it seems likely, with Froben rather than with Eramnus,
had taken delinita sha . Froben had kept seven presses busy on his great
edition 01 Augustino ( p. 1061. 11); when that was 011 his banda, he wanted
some new and large pisce ol work 101· his printers. The Augustino was
finisbed early in September 1529; and a beginning presumably made on 1110
0113000100] immediately. At the beginning ol January 1530 Erasmus writes

argare that the work is to appear in the autumn; at the end 01 tha
month 110 writes to Tunstall grumbling at the slowness 01 1110 translatore
(Ep. 1163. 44). By the end 01 March the printers had gone solar abead that
it had been decided not to wait 101 Brixius' promised version 01 tho 1100001100
(Ep. 2291) : 101 this, and otherworks 01 chrysostom, Froben had to fall back
on oecolampadius—whose delecta as a translator had been widely advertisad
by Brixius (000 Epp. 1051. 111, 1061. 22-4, ol. Ep. 1139. 53-4). In thecatalogue
01 his writings furnishod 10 Boece (Ep. 2283) Erasmus is content, in respect
01 chrysostom, 10 0001001010 the works translated by himsell (11. 155-65);
and makes no 010110 10 any share in the general editoris! labour—what ba
tells Boece 01 his work on the Augustino (1. 116) and the Hilary (1. 219) stands
in marked contrast. It is probable that he 1001 10 Froben his name and 00011
help 00 he could give in securing new versione, without taking on himself 1110
heavier editorial responsibilities.

Froben's five volumes were scarcely published when Erasmus wrote to
Germanus Brixius asking his assistance lor a supplementary volume (Ep.
1379), which was 1000010111, lateralia, the Homilies on Romans. Brixins
by 1 October 1531 had translated the first eight 01 11100ος and in 1101011
1533 Froben printed this instalment (chrysostomi 111 epist. . . . od 1101110000
1101011100 0010 priores), publishing at the same time, in a separate volume,
Erasmus' 11119001 Hamillus ad 3110101010 000100ίὸ1100. Βο1 almost immediately
both Erasmus and Brixius began 10 10101001 themselves in 011 undertaking
designed to supersede Froben's chrysostom—the edition, namely, 01 che-
vallon, printed at Paris in 1536. In the Leipzig University Library (Bursoher
Sammlung, Misc.) are 5 us. leaves written by Erasmus’ secmtnry, Gilbert
Cognatum the first containing corrections 01 Ε1000100’ translation (1530, i.
108) 01 the Homilies on Philippians, the other 1001 giving corrections 01
Brixius’ version 01 Romans. Ahnost all the corrections are adopted in
cbevallon's chrysostom where the Homilies on Philippians 010 given
‘Erasmo Roterodamo interprete, locis aliquot per ipsum restitutis ex aedi·
tione Veronensi'. The chevallon chrysostom 1011101110 0100, 1011110 first
time, Erasmus' translation 01 the 111000(οω Ep. 2²7· 111). It seems clear,
therefore, 11101111 1533 Erasmus was cognitent ol, and assisting, chevallon’s
undertaking (he assisted‚ in the same year, the chevallon 1010100). Τ110
chevallon chrysostom was edited by Jo. Eucherius and Brixiam and Ep.
24²²· 25n.‚ suggests that the project 0111 was already being considered
in 1531. chevallon's edition is-like all the early editions 01 cbrysostom
-a rare book. There is a copy 01 11 in 1110 Bibliotheque Nationale; but
perhaps the only other copy is that in the Chapter Library at Wells (G. 2.
11-15). The early editions, bulky lolios, were perhaps discsrded lrom tbs
