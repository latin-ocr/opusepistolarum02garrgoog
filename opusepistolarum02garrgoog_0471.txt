[An original letter, autograph throughout: no doubt from the same place
and date as Ep. 2609.]

ἦ.

Quamvis scirem non esse opus Polyphemo nostro mea ad te
commendatione, Erasme doctissime (quid enim multis commen·
darem notissimum tibi 1), tamen, vt ne mec quidem officio deessem,
bomini amico hoc elogion veluti corollarium proficiscenti dedi.

Video enim, quod tibi non puto non summe placiturum, proficisci 5
non sine litteris optimi Principis nostri Electoris Saxoniae, hones·
tatis et probitatis eius testibus non vulgaribus; deinde etiam
epistola D. cancellarii doctoris Christanni Bowarii‚ compatris mei
charissimi. Neque ego seiam esse vllos quos Polyphemus noster
vel in aula nostra vel alibi offenderit. Tam gratiosus est, hcc ιο
fortassis ex Gratiis, hoc est, ex litteris ipsis, hoc est, Gratiarum
matribus nato. Haec pro Polyphemo nostro; libenter enim grati·

[The prelaceto Froben’s Greek Β1111,Μ11111 1531, the first edition ol Basil
in the Greek. It would seem that Erasmus directed the enterprise (ei. Ep.
1516. 13 n), though he diselaims editorial 11191111111117111111.1-4)ι in omit·
ting the Commentarios onIsaiah Froben was presumably guided by Erasmus,
who had questioned their genuineness (Ep. 229. 5-14) 11 early 11 1511, when
he took with him to Cambridge Grocin‘s 111. 11 these Commentarios and
translated thern. (This 111. does not appear in the list oi Grecin's books

rinted in Merton Munimentr-the only Basil in the list 11 that now in the
iibrary ol Corpus Christi College, Oxiord, Cor 17.) Erasmus contemplated
at that time a translation 11 Β1111, which was to be associated with Fisher
and with the university oi Cambridge. But he dropped the project when
he found that it was not encouraged by Fisber to whom he had offered his
version ol the Isaiah Commentaries (Epp. 119, 137). He did not publish
this version until 1518, when Froben printed it with his edition ol the
Fachiridion. Erasmus’ interest in Bssil continued; in 1518 he asked
Pirckheimer to send him a manuscriptos Basil (Epp. 1997. 11-13, 1118. 1-3),
which was possibly the manuscript iorwarded by Erasmus to levinus
Ammonius, with the request that he would copy it (Ep. 2214. 7n). It was
plainly Erasmus’ occupatiori with this edition that prompted him to under·
take his translation ol the Dc Laudibus ieiunii, Freiburg, Emmeus, 1531
(already translated by Raphaol Rhegius) and ol the hitherto untranslated Dc
Spiritu Sancto, Basle, Froben, 1531. There is a manuscript (l late xviiia) ol
this preiace in theVatican Library (MS. 011. 3174, uo. 1), but an examination
ol its errore shows 11 11 be oi no velue]
