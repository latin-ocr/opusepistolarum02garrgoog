[Τ110 letters of Cornelius Agrippa are preserved in his opem rinted in
slightly differing editions at Lyons ⁸ per Beringos fratres ⁹. one of tl
editions bears any date except one, dated 1600. In none of the edition
there any indication of sources, nor is there any editor's Preface. 'l'he Lem
were presumably derived from Agrippa's papers. That there is 110 reason
suspect the genuineness of the collection, seems indicated, as far as Ernst
is concerned, by the fact that for Ep. 2626 we still have Agrippa's origi
letter (Breslau MS. Rehd. 254. 4).

Henricus Cornelius Agrip (von Nettesheim) (1486—1535) was born
Cologne, of a noble family w 'ch had been for four generations in the sen
of the House of Austria; from his earliest years he was destined for ¹.
same service (Aqr. E. 970-1, 1021). He is believed to have been educat
first at Cologne University, and later at the University of Paris—a let
of Capito in which he is spoken of as ‘ educatione Italus' is perhaps to
understood of his later connexione with Italy. His early are in fae
involved in considerable obscurity. His letters show him, uring the pen¹

in the service of Maximilian 1, and acting as his secret agent, is not 010
But the adventure seems to have been hatched in the student circlos
Paris—among Agrippa’s fellow-conspirators was Germanus Brixius (ΑΨ.
682, 687). Agrippa speaks of himself as having been one of Maximilm
under-secretarios (Aqr. E. 1021), but it is not clear whether the stateme
refers to the period before or after the Catalonian adventure. In the 1
sensio Propositionum (see below) he tells us that in 1509 110 lectured publi«
011 ⁸ sacred letters ⁹ in the University of Dole. His subject was the .
Mirifice Verbo of Reuehlim and it was to Reuchlin that he owed t
cabalistic interests which were the obsession of his learning. He tells
