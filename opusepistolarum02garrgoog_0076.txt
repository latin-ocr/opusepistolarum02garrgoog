Erasmus, writing ιο him on 12 Feb. 1536, complains of not having heard
from him, und speaks of expecting ιο see him in the spring. It seems likely
that Cognatus was already meditating commuting his canonry for a pension,
and returning to Basle. On 17 March he writes to Bonifece that he ιιι
‘not yet accepted the bridle‘‚ and is in doubt what ιο do, and would like
Boniface's advice (Basle MS. Ki Ar. 18⁵. 139l· Five days earlier he had
written ιο Erasmus a letter (not extant, but answered by lond. xxvii 51,
LB.1296) in which he had spoken of a project of resigning his can in
return for nn annual payment of boo crowns for six years, a projeet w “ h
Erasmus approvee. On 7 May he wrote ιο Erasmus that he might be ex·
pected in Basle on 1 Oct. But the death of Erasmus in July put an end ιο
ιιο project. ‘Would that I had lost all my beneficas rather than my
maeter', he writes to Boniface (Basle MS. Ki. Ar. 18⁸. 140). Ten years later,
consoling Henri Colin for the death of his mother. he makes compenson ol
hia own grief on the death of Erasmus (Cog. E. i, p. 233). From 1535 ιο
1567 he remuined in Nozeroy, almost continuously, teaching and writing.
His Library (depicted in his Burgundiae Descriptio, Cog. E. i, p. 330) wne
famous (see Cog. E. i, pp. 314·¹ 5, 426). Among his pupils were Leuis arrd
Jerome Colin, ιο whom hia Syntaxeoa Tabulae is addressed, Guillaume, Jeen,
and Claude de la Baume, besides the sons of his Basle friends Conrad Amor·
bach, Herold, Gelenius, and H. Petri, and three Englishmen, Henry Daubeuy.
John Pellaeus (Old f), Hugh Grecn (Cog. li. i, pp. 428, 432). In a letter ιο
Jean dela Baume (Cog. E. i. p. ³17) he mentions a project of joining him in
Paris, and sends graetings ιο Peter Ramus. llis acquaintance with Remus,
mentioned again in Cog. E. ii, p. 59, makes it probable thet he had met him
at some time in Paris. In the summer of 1557 he visited Basle lor the
purpose of seeiug through the press his edition of the Homilies of Canariae
of Aries-this was a work of some impert-anco, since the Homilies hed not
before been printed. From March 1558 ιο April 1560 he travelled in Italy
with Claude de la Baume, the youthful archbishop of Besaneon. But
except for these two journeys, he seems ιο have lived in his native Noreroy,
for the most part peacefully, until 1567. In 1554 he was called upon ιο face
a charge of heresy. But he had powerful friends, and defended himself
successfully. The Emperor, while bis cause was peuding, invited him to
court, the invitation being written in charles' own hand (Basle MS. G. 11. 4⁰·
11ο), and in 1555 granted him a patent of nobility. The accusation of
heresy was, however, renewed in 1563: and again in 1567. In Aug. 1567 he
was arrestari and sent to Dolo, where he remained in detention, though not
titt. ¹3⁰233¹8>3¹tutudit{titpttssssttptt titt litt}
before the court of the archbishop of Besancon. His trial seems not ιο have
been concluded when, on 22 May 1572, he died in prison (the date of hu
death is established by a letter of 25 June 1572 from Hugues (louein ιο
Zwinger, Basle MS. Fr. Gr. I. 15. 78).

A collected edition of the works of Cognatus was published during hie
lifetime ( era Multijarii Argumenti, Baelo, H. Petri, 1562). His earliest
work, the ἱκέτης, 1535, was frequently reprinted; and its vogue is illustrated
ιγ ιιο translation of it made by Sir T. Chaloner, and published by Tho.
Berthe<let> in 1543. It was followed by a translation of the Aristotelian
Oeconomico-a work which dictated the form and style of the ozris-qu and
Oratio in Concordiae Commendationem, Erasmian in subject, in style rhe-
torical (at the endere a number of letters). Works of the decade following
are: De lesu Christi Sacerdotio Narratiuncula, 1541 ; syntaxeos Tabulae, 15423
