PREFACE

IS volume is iu large part the work of P. S. Allen. He
collected the letters and arranged them provisionally in order
of dete: only a few have had to be shifted as further facts came
ιο light. He collated all the MSS. and himself copied those more
difficult to decipher. The hurried notes of Bernard of Oles, the
seemingly illegible rough·draits of Bonifaoe Amerbach, and the
hastily written letters of Erasmus himself in the Copenhagen MS.
