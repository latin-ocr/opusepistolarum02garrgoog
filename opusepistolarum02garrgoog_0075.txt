5011 and a hali, thereafter transferring himself ιο medicine and theology.
He speaks oi himselfas studying underPetrus Phoenix(professor of civil law)
and Jsc. 1101ι1-10111005. Ε. 1, p. 343). According to P-A. Pidoux he studied
law under Zasius-for evidence that Zasius was at Dola at this time Pidoux
refers to a document, not listed, in the publio library 01 Βο111901-1111 001-
tainly in ch. Ε. 1, p. 318 cognatus speaks 01 Zasius 11 the toacher 01 himself
and his friends Metellus and Roaarius. Metellus and Cognatushadcertainly
been together 1ι Dola (Cog. Ε. 1, p. 296). But cog. Ε. 1, pp. 296 and 315
suggest that Metellus and Roaarius may have been in Freiburg with Cognatus
(at a later date we find Metellus in Bologna, Cog. E. i, p. 316). Another 01
cognatus· teacbers was Boniface Amerbsch. Numerone letters passed be·
tween them from 1533 ιο 1562; and in these 110 addresses Amerbach 11 ‘his
worshipiul toacher ’. It seems likely, therefore, that c. 1529 he went ιο
Βο110, and continued there his legal studies. Later, among his Noseroy
pupils, were the sons 01 several 01 the Basle litterati. We may suppose that
it was in Basle that he first mede acquaintance with Erasmus. He would
have accompanied him the more readily to Freiburg if he was there to
resume intercourse with his old tutor Zasius. The date at which 110 entered
Erasrous' service can be determined fairly closely. In 1 1οιιο1 ιο Erasmus
01 24 Dec. 1535 he speaks 01 himself aa having been in 111101110010131111
mima 1111111 and this is consistent with 1011111146, LB. 1163111010,
in Dec. 1533, Erasmus speaks of Cognatus’ three years’ service. His oon-
00 tion 01 the duties 01 his position with Erasmus is prettilyslretched in his
0 11511110 de Officio Famulorum, published in Basle by Froben 111 August
1535, J'ust before he left Erasmus (Cog. Ε. 1, p. 313). To ι10 period 01 his
service with Erasmus belong the first seven 01 ι10 1οιιο11 ιο Βο111100 men·
tioned above3 and a number 01 1οιιο11 from Odonus (Cog. E. i, pp. 306-14).
While with Erasmus he visited his native B dy 1ι 1011ι thrice. The
first recorded visit falls between 12 Oct. and rffi. 1533. 01 this occasion
10 brought bmlr wine 101 Erasmus, and apparently 1 living for himself, given
ιο hirn by his kinsman De Vers (Lond. xxvii. 45, 48, LB. 1256, 1262). 11 1
1οιιο1 01 1565 (Basle MS. Fr. Gr. ΙΙ. 27, 551) he speaks of himself as having
been called ed alemanicum munus thirty-three years previously. In Dec.
110 was back again at Besanpon, and we find Erasmus writing letters on his
bahali to De Vere and F. Bonvalot (1011111111465, LB.1263-4). The
purpose 01 ι1010 101ιο11, worded with reserva, seems ιο 10 ιο arrange that-
Cognatus should return to Freiburg, i.e. that he should hold 1111 benefice in
absence. Nor did he romain in Burgrmdy long. For 11 Lond. xxx. 63, LB.
12⁶6 is written in his hand, he was back in Freiburg sometime before 19 Feb.
1534. His third visit ιο Burgundy was towards the close 01 1534. Ηο writes
to Erasmus from Noaeroy 1 letter, undated (Epistolac Laconicae, 1554, ii.
329), in which he announces his sppointment ιο 1 0110115 1ι Βι. Antony’s in
11010105. From a document, unnumbered, 111 the Library of Besancon (cited
by Pidoux, p. 36) we know that Willism 01 Nassau, seigneur 01 11010105,
111ἀο the sppointment on 41111535. Cognatus’ letter must, however, ante-
date the official sppointment by some days; since Cognatus returned ιο
Freiburg before 1 Jan. 1535 (Basia MS. Ki. Ar. 18⁸. 136). 01 8 Feb. 1535
10 writes to Boniface that he has ‘decided not ιο leave his master, so long
as his master has need 01 him, since he loves him more than rich beneficas
or the whole Papacy‘ (Baelo MS. Ki. Ar. 18⁸. 137. The letter 100111 ιο 10
answered by Boniiaca’s letterinBasle MS. C. VI⁸. 73. 433.) Accordingly, when
Erasmus left Freiburg for Besle in ι101111111101011535, Cognatus accom-

11 September he was sent back to Freiburg, 111 order to supervrse the sale
01 Ε1111111’ furniture there, and to ay 011 his woman-servant (10111. xxvii.
52, LB. 1289). Erasmus had ho to retain his services till the spring
01 1536. But Cognatus' parents presscd him to come to Noseroy, and early
in October he began ιο prepare his departurefLond. xxvii. 53-4‚ ΕΒ. 1290-11·
