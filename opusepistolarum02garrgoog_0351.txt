An 0111100000 01 1 Α 111 1509 had made attendance at the reformed service
every Sunday comp ry. Boniface had claimed exemption from this
ordinance as one of the conditione of continuing in his Professorship (Am.
E· 47) and the 0000011 had admitted his claim (Am. Ε. 49)- 10 Jan. 1530110
complains that the agreed conditione were not being kept (Am. Ε. 55 = Ep.

2248), and correspon ence with Erasmus during the first four months 01 1530
has various references to this complaint (Epp. 2256, 2267, 2281, 2312). 00

‘Ban errn' he seems to have 0001001011 himself with repeating the argu·

decided to review the whole matter themselves (Am. E· 74) t audone Sept.
he was summoned before that body (Am. Ε. 75, 79). He asired ior a delay
