The writer 01 the letteris John Albert Widmanstetter, 1506-57, who at
one time Latinized his surnsme as Oesiander, later as Widmeetadius-the
additional name Lucretius, taken as a humanistic flourish, was interpreted
by his enemiea as indicating that he did not believe m the immortality oi the
soul. He was born ιι Nellingeu‚ near Ulm, and edueatad' ιιι the first
instance at Tebingen. But sinoe he names among bis teoehers ιιι Germany
Sebastiau Munster, Glareanus, and Boniiaoe Amerbaoh, he may be supposed
to have studied also at Heidelberg end Basle-in Basle he, no doubt, made
aoquaintanoe with Erasmus. In 15ι71ιι betoolr himself to Italy, where,
besides stud ying Greek, he learned Hebrew, Arabio, and syn ao. His
Hebrew he got irom Dattilus, once the teaoher oi Pioo Mirandola, his
Arabio irom Erasmus‘ adversary Stunioa. In Τιιιίιι he was taughtp hilo·
sophy bytho Soet John Ramsay. He seems to have leit Turin 111 or before
153011Θ known irom a statement 01 his own that he was in Naples' ιιι ι1ιιι
year (Miiller,p ..16) His presenoe at Naples ιιι 1551 has independent
attestation m the Prelaoe 01 Io. Pierius Cyminius to his edition 01 Charisius.
Pierius speaks oi him as lecturing' ιιι Naples' m that year. In 1533 he was in
Rome, iorin the summer he met (1ιο Logus (Ep. 2568. 15n) and persuaded
himtoeditGratius, Nemesianus, and theHalieutioaoi Ovid. In 1539inRome
he was sharing a lod gwith Ambrose Gumppenberg (see Ep. 2619 introd. ).
An obscure ieud wit Gumppenberg lasted irom 1540 too. 1552. In Rome
hs became aoquainted with another 01 Erasmus’ enemies, 'Eugubinusz -
Eugubinus told him that he had lived to doubt the genuineness oi the
Donation 01 Constantine. His talenta were employed by a variety 01 patrous.
He became seoretary suooessively to clement vn and Paul 111. In 1543 he
plublished his first book: Matonem Abdallae filii theologia dialogo explicatu

onnonno Nellinpounense interprete. Alooruni Epitonrs Roberto Kstenmse
Angla interprete. Iohannis Altera Vaidmestadii Iurisconsulti Notationes

This book was dedicated to Prinos Ludwig 01 Bavaria, whom he served
1539-45, passing then to the ser-vioe ο1 his brother, Abp. Ernst. Iu the
year iollowing he went to Augsburg, beooming ohaneellor to Cardinal
Otto Tmchsess, whom be aooompanied ιο the papal election 01 1550. In
1552 he beoame ohanoellor to King Perdinand. In the same year he

ublished Von den geistliehsn und weldiohen Wuppen eines Rittcrs, Dillingen,
ἒ. Meyer. He had married in 154ι Ann 01 Leonsborg, a natural daughter
01 Duke Ludwig. In 1556 his wife died; and he took the resolution to
retire from the world. He was ordained in 1557111111 appointed to a eanonry
at Ratisbon, where he died a mouth later. His most notable work, his
edition oi the Syriae version 01 the New Testament, was published in Vienna
by Zimmermanu in 1555. The Syriae version had not been printed beiore;
and Widmanstetter's edition oi it was iollowed in the next year by his
Syriacae linpuue prima elemento, Vienna, Zimmerrnann. A history 01 the
bishops 01 Salzburg, whioh he wrote 0. 1548, was published in Munster's
Oosmogropltio. Widmanstetter oolleoted a noble library, 01 500 printed
books and more than 300 MSS. This library, aoquired by Duke Albert v
