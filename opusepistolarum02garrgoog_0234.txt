[An original letter, written by Erasmus 2221 addresaed by Quirinus
Tslesius.

The year-date can be sup lied by comparison with Epp. 2472, 2474, 2477,
2497, 2525-5. Τ122 2222212- 222 12 supported hythe contenta 21 2122 122222;
Erasmus 1222 just received (2) a demand ferrent 21 2122 house, Francis·
kanergasse, no. 5 ‘an Wallfisch ’, in which he had been living since April
2529, and (b) 3 months’ notice to quit: the demand, and 2122 222122 22 quit,
both suit Lady Day.

Thebanae had been built by Jamee Villinger (whom Erasmus, by error,
12222 22112 John Villinger) for the Emperor Maximilian, who had, however,
never taken possession 21 it. It remained unfinished (Ep. 2112. 25-26). 2221
22 Villinger's death it passed 221212 heire. Ep. 2497 speaks 21 12 22 belonging
to his son, who was presumably a minor, 21222 2122 property was administered
by his widow and her second husband, John Loeble.

01 2122 dispute with which this letter ia concerned Erasmus gives a long
but somewhat confused account in Ep. 2472, from which, and irom 2222212221
references in other letters, the following facte seem 22 be established.

Until the end of 2529 2122 house seems to have been put hythe Villinger
family at the diaposal 21 2122 municipality 21 Freiburg (Ep. 2112. 252). In
11122212 21 21222 year the burgomaster 21122221 2122 11222 11222 21 12 22 Erasmus
rent-free. When Erasmus took up residence there, Augustius Mariua (Ep.
2321 introd.) occupied another portion of the house on the same terme. Yet
another portion was tenanted 127 Luscinius, by arrangement, not with the
municipality, but with the villingen—according to his own 22222222 122 had
been put into possession 21 2122 whole house by Villinger’a heire, but without
power 22 transfer his rights in 12 22 2 third party. Marius quitted 2122122222

. shortly beiore Christmas 2529, making to the tribune Uln'ch a complimentary
gift 21 two florins; at the same time Erasmus made a similar gift to the
same official 21 four orowns (Ep. 2472. 9-13). Up to this date there seems 2ο
122 agreement between all parties that Erasmus' residence was rent-free-the
claim made on him ferrent excluded the year 1529. At Christmas 2529, the
22222222.2222222222
offer him the whole house, with the court st the back 21 12, 22 a 22222122
1122122 perannum. The changed situation may be inferred to have been
brought about by the marriage of Villipffis widow to John Lceble (see Ep.
2256. 28-31). Erasmus expressed his ' ‘ gness to pay the widow a rent of
12 crowns (ronghly 24 florina: see Ep. 2752. 2-3), provided he might have
the house ‘libera', i.e. without the encumbrance 21 Luscinius, but added
