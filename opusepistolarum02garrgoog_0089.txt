2388] EROM PETER OASTELLANUS 55

quidem respondisti, interim tamen cum tn Germanis qui in
Biturigibus agebant haud infrequenter scriberee; tum vt vllam
occasionem omittam tui salutandi committere non potest meus in ιο

te amor et singularis obseruantia. Insuperque credere vix potes
quanti apud me eat scire quid valeas, quid agas.

Sequor nunc Episcopum Pictauorum, necdum seio quibus con·
ditionibus. Si quid ad me scribis, id erit Lutetiam mittendum
atque inde Bicera, vbi iam per multos annos est regia Francorum. 15
Nihil estquod tuo nomine non seciam, siue preecaeperis siue
vetueris, nihilque posset gratius contingere quam vtpcssemus nos

Sed tandem Deum opt. max. obsecro vt valeas et sis castellani

Peter Monttoert ab Hoefl (son oi Jemes Montioert one ol the two chief
magistrates oi Haarlem) seems to bave made the acquaintance ol Erasmus
some years earlier at Basle; see Q. 79 where he is called ⁸ iuuenis p ' 'osae

roceritatis'; elsewhere “o‘ rolicopx05” (cf. Agr. E. p. 1001). In Apri 1533
be went ιο Freiburg ea the bearer oi an honorarium decreed to Erasmus by
the six States oi Holleud, and was Erasmus’ guest ior six days (OE. pp. 492-3,
Q. 79). On this occasion he selred Erasmus ιο write ιο the Emperor, Queen
Mary, Olah, and others recommending him ior the Provoatship oi Haarlem.
From Erasmus’ letter to the Queen we learn that he wea a youth oi high birth
who had been appointed by the levour oi the Emperor and Quaen Mary com·
manderet St. John et Utrecht; that he had been employed by the Emperor
in connexion with affairs in Germany; that he had been ior three years in
the Ocurtci Albertoi Brandenburg, Cardinal Archbishop oi Maium and that
the Emperor had, at Ratisbon, promised him the Provostship which he
scught (OE. pp. 144, 369-72). Erasmus in the letters which he wrote on his
behalt speaks oi him in terme oi high compliment. But shortly afterwards
he discovered, or believed himself to have discovered, that Peter had ected
dishonestly in the matter oi the honorarium (OE. p . 492-3, LB. 1251): the
subject is mentioned in a letter trem Goclenius to rssmus oi 26 July 1533
(Besle MS. Goclenii Ep. 6). EE. identiiy him with Petr. a Montiocrt
Haerlemeus‚ who addressed a Comen matuletorium to the Bishop oi Liege,
Cornelius a Bergen, in 1539]
