He supposed himself, accordingly, ιο ιο living 111 ιιο house on the same
terrnsasbefore (Ε11.2470. 29-31). From Ep. 2256. 28-31, it would appear that
Villinger‘s widow and her new husband were thought likely ιο take up

willing neither ιο sell nor to let it, and he was expecting notice ιο (init, cf.
Ep. 2330. 21-4. Luscinius moved out of the house early in 1530, eaving
behind, however, some 01 ι10 chattels‚ retaining the heys, and making

with the Villingers, the whole house-including the portion occupied by
Erasmus—was his.

What rights in the house, if any, Luscinius in fact possessed we baveno

a part of it had been occupied throughout by Luscinius. It is not easy ιο
000 why he had not troubled himself ιο 01001 up the matter of the rent with
the tribune, for he admits that Luscinius‘ statements had caused him per·

It seems that as late as 1533 Ioeble's agents were still demanding rent from
