Gilbertus Cognatus (Gilbert Cousin), 1506-72, was born at Ncaeroy, of
a family of some local consideration. In 1111 Manum, a calendar cf the
31011 events of the world, be recorda the date of his birth (21 Jan. 1506)
with the same solemnity aa that with which he recorda the date cf Erannm'
death. He gives the same date in his Burgundios Descriptio (Cog. Ε. 1. 332);
and the 1506 11 apparently NS (the reclroning which 110 11101 elsewhere). In
a letter, however, ol 27 Aug. 1567 (Basle MS. Fr. Gr. 11. 27. 551) he speaks
of himself as 1010911110 tres annos notus, which would take us back to 15044
and the recorda of his trial in 1572, preserved at Besancon (Pidoux, p. 111),
give the year ol his birth 011515. His father, Claude Cousin, married Jeenne
Dsguet, by whom he had ten children. Six sons were soldiers, four of them
dying in battle, one of them living ιο have 22 children. His brother
Hugues held an appointment in the household ol the French king (Basle Mn.
Fr. Gr. 11. 27. 55¹²). The grandfather, Guilleume Cousin, was twice married3
and by his marriages cognatus was related to Louis de Vers (to whom
Erasmus addresses Lond. xxvii. 46, LB. 1263) and to Henri Colin, to whose
sons Cognatus acted as tutor, and ιο whom in 1546 he addressed a 001110·

a boy, he wrote verses which 110 thought worth publishing at a later date
