01 Augustinus Steuchus Eugubinus‚ Venice, Aldus, 1509. The year-date 01
the letter is not confirmed from other sources, though perhaps the phrase
editio primo inline 71 mayindicate thatErasmushadheard 011110 preparation
of the second edition of Steuchus’ book. which appeared in 1531, from
Gryphius’ press at Lyons. The letter was printed by Erasmus in J, and
all the subsequent editions. 8101101100 printed it (with his anewer) in In
Psalmum cciii et 00000111 interpretatio, Lyons, Gryphius‚ 1533 (α); but his
text diliers from that of J and presumably reproduces the original letter sent
to him by Erasmus. We have therefore given the preference to o.

Guido 81000110 (14081-1548) was born at Gubbio. 0 small town in the
Umbrian Appenines‚ the ancient Iguuium, called in medieval times Eugubium
(the name of the town was the subject of a dissertation which he published
in 1540, with the approval and help of Angelo 0010001 0111 01000110 Torelli).
His father was Theseo 8100111, 0 small local landowner; his uncle Francesco
81110111 was 001101 01 the cathedral church of Gubbio. In 1513 he entered the
monastery of St. Secundus at Gubbio, becoming thereby 01 Augustinian
canon of 81. Saviour's 01 Βο103110, changing his name from Guido to
Augustinus. In the spring of 1517 he went from Gubbio 1ο Βο10310, where
he remained continuously (except for 010 year, 1501, 11 which he was 01
81. Saviour's in Venice) until 1505. In that year he was transferred to the
monastery of St. Antony at Venice, which had recently ecquired the noble
library of cardinal Domenico Grimani(† 1503), There Steuchus held tha
office of librarian from 150510 1500, 0111 was active in teaching both Latin
and Greek. In 1509 he published his 11101 book, the Reeopnitio Veteris Tecto·
matii ior it he had drawn on the wealth of the Grimani library; see the
dedication to cardinal Marino 01111011 0111 the proface. In the same year
he was transferred as prior 10 81. Mark’s at Reggio. In 1530 his Pro
relipione Christiana aduersae 1011010000, in three books, was printed at
Bologna, with 0 dedication to cardinal Alexander Famese, subsequently
Pope Paul 111. lt is from Reggio that he writes to Erasmus (Ep. 0513) 0111
11 1533 011111000οο 10 Julius Pflug the dedication to the Ia Psalmam attiii et
00000111 interpretatio, inviting him 10 adjudicate in the controversy with
Erasmus. Pflug‚ however, in 0 letter 10 Erasmus of 5 May 1533 speaks with
disapprovalof Steuchus‘ attack on German scholarehip; though he mentions
that Steuchus had shown him courtesy at Venice and given him 000000 to
the library 01 81. Antony. Before the end of 1533 Steuchus had been
appointed prior 01 his old monastery of St. Secundus at Gubbio. In April
1534 he was made prior of St. John Baptist at St. Arcangelo near Rimini;
but without residing 110 went to Rome, resigning the position in 1535. In
that year he printed with Gryphius and dedicated to Paul 111 0 tripartite
volume: i. Oestnopoeio cel de montano opificio, ii. De rebar incorporeis et
iaairihilihas, iii. An 0010010 editio eit diui Hieronymi3 iii mentions (p. 008)
the Froben Jerome in complimentary terma. Early in 1538 he was made
bishop of Kisamo in Crete (a letter of Calcagniuus of 20 Feb. 1538 congratu-
